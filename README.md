The MERN-Bank-Web-App project is a web application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) that simulates a banking app. Users can create accounts, log in, view their account balance and transaction history, and make transfers between accounts. The app also includes authentication and authorization features to ensure the security of users' banking information. The project is a good example of how to build a full-stack web application using the MERN stack and how to implement user authentication and authorization features
